Hi, I'm Malekai, a code enthusiast working on Rust & TypeScript projects. I'm currently on hiatus from posting on StackOverflow and contributing to [GitHub](https://github.com/Malekaia) because of work, but my portfolio [posts](https://malekai.co.uk/posts)/[projects](https://malekai.co.uk/projects) are still publicly available and open source, as are my Stack Overflow [questions](https://stackoverflow.com/users/10415695/malekai?tab=questions) and [answers](https://stackoverflow.com/users/10415695/malekai?tab=answers). Feel free to contact me on [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/Melekaia) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Malekaia/) or follow for (sporadic) updates. You can also contact me via email at `contact[at]<NAME>[dot]co[dot]uk`.
